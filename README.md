We make java say "Hello World"

1) We created a thread for each character to print. Each character is represented in a different base ranging from base 2 -> 12. We also made it 1 line
2) We could have opened a new terminal window for each character
3) We learned that you can run a single line program. java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec() is difficult to use.
