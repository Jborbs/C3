We like random numbers, we like loops, and we LOVE ugly code. So, we put all of that together (also, we like casting).

If we had more time, we would have found the worst place for recursion, and put it there.
One of our goals was to implement a really bad sort algorithm to sort a random sequence of characters until it was correct.
Another of our ideas was to place all of the possible characters into a binary tree, and searched through it randomly until we found the correct sequence.

We learned a lot of IntelliJ features, such as how to refactor variable names, how to use Git on the IDE, and how to automate imports.
