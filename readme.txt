Our helloworld calls a function for each letter that adds the respective letter to an array.
Then, we loop through the array to print out Hello World.

If given more time, we would have formatted our script in a more convoluted way. 

One thing we all learned: We got a refresher course on arrays and the difference between Character and char
in java.
