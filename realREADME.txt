Essentially what we did was create classes for every letter in hello world
From this we created an object of each
From this we called the getter of each object and got each letter
From this we wrote the sentence "Hello World" :)
WHAT WE LEARNED:
    Don't like convoluted code
WHAT WOULD WE HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY
    Implement a DFS of hello world
