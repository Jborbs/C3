Get ready for a "world" of fun!

To run:

output should be: Hello World!

We hope that your experience was out of this "world." Goodbye world!

  Our strategy was to chain the functions so that every new letter had to make a new function call. We also had the code written as an int casted to a character at each function.

Another thing we could have done is adding in more junk code in between the functions we used.
3. What have you all learned from the exercise?
      Communication and a clear vision is key when working in this type of environment. We also learned the difficulties in trying to It is very difficult to try and work on one file in real-time. We
